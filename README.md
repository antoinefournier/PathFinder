==========

PathFinder is a 2D A* pathfinding implemented in C++ initially set up for a Minecraft like project.
It is actually linked to this project but can be easily imported into another project with minimum changes.

The main features are :
 - the ability to start multiple computations and run them at the same time.
 - the ability to give a maximum time per frame for the computations and their automatic distribution on multiple frames.
